<h3 id="abstract">Abstract</h3>

<p>Ideology has been a focus issue in the domain of political science. Researchers have long depended on a survey to measure political attitudes, but the method is expensive and limited to time and space. Hence, a great many studies took an unconventional approach to quantify ideology based on discrete behavioral data, including roll-call votes and social media’s endorsement, and generated reliable outcomes. This study contributed to that promising research avenue by estimating ideology through people’s reading patterns.</p>

<p>I first harvested 120,000 users’ personal information (e.g., city-level address) and book collections on the most popular Chinese reading website, i.e. Douban.com. I then utilized the method of ideal point estimation to acquire the ideological positions of readers and political books and compared the results with survey data for validation. At last, I calculated the level of economic openness in cities and established the relationship between political preferences and financial openness.</p>

<p>This study found that political books demonstrate liberal ideas, whereas most readers hold relatively less liberal political attitudes and approach the center category of the ideological spectrum. The Douban online community are highly homogenous and display similar political preferences.</p>

</font></p></p>

<p>Model of Ideal Point Estimation</p>

<p>First, I created an affiliation matrix between the political books, and each cell indicates the number of users who read both books (Table 1), A = XX’.</p>

<p><img src="/images/table1.png" alt="Table 1." /><p align="center"><font color=gray size=4>Table 1. The First Ten Rows of the Affiliation Matrix A</font></p></p>

<p>Second, I divided the number of users that read both books by the total number of users that are exposed to each book individually, which yielded an agreement matrix,
G = aij/diag (ai) (Table 2).</p>

<p><img src="/images/table2.png" alt="Table 2." /><p align="center"><font color=gray size=4>Table 2. The First Ten Rows of the Agreement Matrix G</font></p></p>

<p>Next, I employed Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) on the agreement matrix that provided the essential information of co-occurrence required for estimation. Since the left singular vector was irrelevant to the popularity of books, I attained the first rotated left singular value as the ideology score for the political books, as presented in Figure 1. For a visual presentation, I standardized the results to have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one.</p>

<p>This study primarily focuses on estimating the ideology of readers. A fundamental premise of this research is that individuals become aligned with the system of political beliefs through the consumption of books. Therefore, I calculated the average of the scores for political books that users have read as an individual’s ideology measure. The individual scores were also normalized, as displayed in Figure 2.</p>

<p>As shown in Figure 2, a majority of political books contain liberal ideas, the ideological scores of the political books fall chiefly on the right side of the political spectrum.</p>

<p><img src="/images/ideological_space.jpeg" alt="Figure 2." height="400"/><p align="left"><font color=gray size=4>Figure 2. Density Plot of Ideological Estimates of Political Books</font></p></p>

<p>I also identified the positions of ten books that reinforced the validity of the conclusion, though meticulous validation procedures should be conducted for the next stage of my research.</p>

<p><img src="/images/ideology_scores.png" alt="Figure 3." height="400"/><p align="left"><font color=gray size=4>Figure 3. Density Plots of Ideological Estimates of Both Individuals and Political Books</font></p></p>

<p>Figure 2 indicates that the distribution of individuals’ ideology scores skews left, which reveals that a substantial number of users embrace liberal political attitudes. The ideological scores are the same unimodally distributed as those for political books. However, the scores for most users are comparatively lower. In other words, a large number of readers hold less liberal beliefs even though they are exposed to books comprising radical political thoughts</p>
