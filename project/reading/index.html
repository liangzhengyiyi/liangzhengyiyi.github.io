<h3 id="abstract">Abstract</h3>

<p>Ideology develops in connection with material social processes that disseminate thoughts and ideas by means of cultural products and commodities. We argue that, apart from surveying attitudes towards essential issues, ideology can be observed by examining the mediums through which political beliefs are available to individuals. In this paper, we proposed an innovative approach to estimating readers’ political ideology from the consumption of political books based on large-scale data. We further explored the interplay of ideology and science by revealing the politically stratified readers’ interest in scientific books. By analyzing online reading behavior, our study found that the majority of Chinese readers approach the center of the ideological spectrum, suggesting a substantial overlap of political values. Furthermore, science appears to be more associated with political readers than nonscientific topics. More specifically, liberal readers prefer economics books, while conservative readers favor technology books. We seek to enlighten the political nature of reading and the cultural divisions associated with political differences.</p>

<h4 id="research-questions">Research Questions</h4>

<p>Our study concentrates on the relationship between political ideology and book consumption, which is presented by a conceptual diagram in Figure 1. We attempt to reveal the insightful linkage by proposing two research questions. First, ideology is reflected by reading habits. Beliefs and values are infused into intellectual goods, making reading far from an isolated behavior. Thus, we argue that ideology can be grasped by scrutinizing the mediums through which political beliefs are available to readers and put forward the first question:</p>

<p>RQ1: How can political ideology be estimated from the consumption of political books?</p>

<p>Second, scientific consensus is increasingly motivated by ideological reasoning rather than empirical evidence. Our study does not address the ideology of scientists but the ideology of readers interested in scientific books. Politicized science may not only undermine trust in the scientific community but also sway significant decisions related to the common good. However, the mechanism underlying the interaction of ideology and science remains unclear. Our research seeks to address the issue and thereby raise our second question:</p>

<p>RQ2: How does political ideology associate with the interest in science books?</p>

<h4 id="findings">Findings</h4>

<p><img src="/images/ideologyScore.jpg" alt="figure 2" title="ideology score" />
<p align="center"><font color=gray size=4></font></p></p>

<p>Figure 2 delineates a portrait of the ideological estimates of both politically interested readers and political books. Taken as a whole, the ideology scores of individuals and books follow the unimodal distribution. Most political books fall on the right side of the ideological spectrum, indicating books on democracy enjoy wide popularity in the online community. The finding from the model is consistent when we ranked the political books by popularity. More importantly, readers’ ideology scores display an intriguing pattern. The majority of viewers gather close at the center of the ideological spectrum, suggesting a substantial overlap of political views. Readers maintain moderate distance within the space and own ideological differences in political institutions.</p>

<p><img src="/images/measurements.jpg" alt="figure 3" title="measurements" />
<p align="center"><font color=gray size=4></font></p></p>

<p>We calculated political pertinence by identifying the overlapped interest within a discipline between political readers and all viewers. Figure 3 demonstrates the likelihood that a discipline is relevant to politically interested readers. The longer a bar, the higher the likelihood that political viewers read the book category. Political readers favor social science above others, including economics, sociology, and psychology. As a whole, politically interested readers prefer social science and natural science over humanities. The pattern stands robust if we look beyond into subcategories, as shown on the right part of the plot. Overall, science appears to be more associated with politics compared with nonscientific topics.</p>

<p>Political propensity indicated by color measures the extent to which a book category is liberal-leaning. Cyan bars tilt towards liberal readers, while red bars lean towards conservative readers. Besides, white bars represent the subjects in which readers share a similar interest. In figure 3, social science and natural science are dominated by liberal readers, whereas humanities build a common ground for politically stratified readers. However, the pattern alters when we switch our focus to subcategories. Liberal readers prefer social science and natural science subjects, but conservative readers favor technology, literature, and linguistics. Delving into subcategories provides a more diverged view of readers’ preferences than general classifications.</p>

<p><img src="/images/sciencebooks.jpg" alt="figure 4" title="sciencebooks" />
<p align="center"><font color=gray size=4></font></p></p>

<p>Figure 4a showed that economics books are more associated with liberal readers. In general, the publications belong to academic and classic texts that cover a wide range of areas in micro and macroeconomics. A majority of the economics books were written by prominent western scholars who have a tendency to promote free market and economic equality, for example, <em>The Constitution of Liberty</em> by Friedrich A. Hayek and <em>Capital in the Twenty-First Century</em> by Thomas Piketty. In contrast, technology books are more related to conservative readers. The book list chiefly falls within the scope of architecture design and computer science, and the latter category serves as a crucial competence in modern societies. The materials usually contain practical ideas and manual instructions.</p>

<p><img src="/images/sciencebooks2.jpg" alt="figure 4" title="sciencebooks2" />
<p align="center"><font color=gray size=4></font></p></p>

<p>Intriguing findings emerged when we carried out a similar analysis on sociology and philosophy books. In figure 4b, sociology books are predominantly read by liberal readers in an academic context, such as
<em>Sociological Imagination</em> and <em>The Presentation of Self</em> in Everyday Life. The books tend to incorporate obscure social concepts and critical arguments. However, practical philosophy is more associated with conservative readers. The book collection resembles self-help books that teach people helpful techniques to live a fulfilling and meaningful life. Self-care books are practical and thus more popular among the general public.</p>
