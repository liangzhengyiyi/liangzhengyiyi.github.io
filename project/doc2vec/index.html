<p>How do Chinese perceive and apprehend politics?</p>

<h4 id="methodology">Methodology</h4>

<p>A public-available word embedding dataset trained by the Word2vec/skip gram algorithm is obtained to examine political connotations. The word embedding model is appropriate to represent political associations based on three reasons. First, it was trained by a large corpus covering various subjects, such as People&rsquo;s Daily News, Baidu Encyclopedia, Weibo (equivalent of Tweeter) and literature. Specifically, the corpus encompasses political coverage on the news outlets and political discussions on social media, which enables the embedding model to capture underlying political connotations among words. In addition, the model demonstrates high accuracy when researchers evaluate the performance of word representations by the CA_translated dataset, a commonly used benchmark for assessment (Li et al., 2018). Third, the model is widely used by some published papers and ongoing projects which provides high quality Chinese word vectors (Gong &amp; Yao, 2019, Qiu et al., 2018, Hu et al., 2019).</p>

<p>Word pairs to construct political dimensions:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Collectivism-Individualism :集体—个人; 集体主义—个人主义; 集体利益—个人利益; 国家—个体</p></li>

<li><p>Conservatism- Liberalism: 保守—自由; 保守主义—自由主义; 保守派—自由派</p></li>

<li><p>Socialism—Capitalism: 资本主义—社会主义</p></li>

<li><p>Authoritarianism—Democracy: 权威—民主</p></li>
</ol>

<h4 id="result">Result</h4>

<p>Figure 1</p>

<p><img src="/images/Picture 1.png" alt="A." /><p align="center"><font color=gray size=4>A. Collectivism-Individualism</font></p></p>

<p><img src="/images/Picture4.png" alt="B." /><p align="center"><font color=gray size=4>B. Conservatism- Liberalism</font></p></p>

<p><img src="/images/Picture2.png" alt="C." /><p align="center"><font color=gray size=4>C. Socialism—Capitalism</font></p></p>

<p><img src="/images/Picture3.png" alt="D." /><p align="center"><font color=gray size=4>D. Authoritarianism—Democracy</font></p></p>

<p>Figure 1 shows the projection of ten countries that are closely connected with China onto the political dimensions. The results are meaningful and intriguing. In A, North Korea, China, Russia and Japan project closest to the Collectivism dimension, while western countries like USA and Britain are relatively further from the side of the dimension, indicating a consistent relationship with common knowledge. It is important to point out that all the countries project on the side of Collectivism dimension. One possible explanation is that due to the censorship, most public articles evade the discussions of sensitive political issues such as human rights, freedom of speech and the right to assemble peaceably. These invisible issues are the key components to characterize individualism. Additionally, the embedding model displays high accuracy when it comes to identify the countries’ political systems. In C, China, North Korea, Cuba are positioned on the side of socialism, whereas USA, Britain, Japan, French and German project onto the capitalism dimension.</p>

<p>In B and D, on the political dimensions of Conservatism-Liberalism and Authoritarianism-Democracy, the angles of projection words appear to be approximately orthogonal, suggesting that the relations between words and dimensions are semantically and contextually irrelevant. Polysemy can account for the outcomes. The definition of liberalism and democracy are ambiguous and debatable in Chinese. China declares itself as a country with democracy and freedom but different from that in western countries. In other words, both China and USA can be characterized as democratic and free countries in text. Hence,  the two dimensions, Conservatism-Liberalism and Authoritarianism—Democracy may not be lucid and reliable to apprehend Chinese politics because the semantic meanings of democracy and liberalism are vague and bewildering in Chinese.</p>
