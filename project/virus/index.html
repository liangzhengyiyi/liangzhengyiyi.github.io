<h3 id="abstract">Abstract</h3>

<p>The epidemic has touched all the continents that humans inhabit within several months. This project seeks to track the spread of the outbreak in different areas and the movement of disease hotspots. Besides, the paper also delineates the overall situation in China, where the government has taken sweeping measures against the greatest outbreak by far and proposes an indicator, intervention efficacy to assess the effectiveness of government intervention in containing the virus. The prevention of coronavirus in China may provide valuable lessons for countries confronting the health threat. Data was collected from the WHO and the National Health Commission of China.</p>

<h3 id="results">Results</h3>

<p><img src="/images/global_outbreak.jpg" alt="figure 1" title="global outbreak" />
<p align="center"><font color=gray size=4>Figure 1. The Spread of Coronavirus among Different Regions</font></p></p>

<p>As shown in figure 1, the pandemic originated from China and sickened tens of thousands of people in one month. Meanwhile, the virus gradually traveled to other countries in the Western Pacific, South-East Asia, Americas, Europe, Eastern Mediterranean and finally Africa. The day of February 20th was a vital turning point in the global health crisis when the number of daily infection cases declined significantly in China and kept at a reduced level ever since. However, the outbreak aggravated in other regions, especially in Europe and the Eastern Mediterranean. According to figure 1, Europe has become a new hotspot with over 7,000 confirmed new cases on March 14th. Besides, the number of infection cases grows moderately in the Americas. It is also noteworthy that South-East Asia is effective in controlling the virus. Although the district is close to China with an original outbreak and reported the first case earlier than Europe, the risk of infection remains comparatively low.</p>

<p><img src="/images/china_outbreak.png" alt="figure 2" title="China outbreak" />
<p align="left"><font color=gray size=4>Figure 2. The Infection, Recovery and Deaths of the Coronavirus Outbreak in China
</font></p></p>

<p>Figure 2 presents the complete situation of the outbreak in China. The tally of the infected accelerated quickly from January 20th. Specifically, the maximum number of daily confirmed cases and dead cases surged to more than 5,000 and 250, respectively. Fortunately, the circumstance has improved since mid-February as the number of recovered people surpassed the number of patients, and casualty figures decreased steadily. The risk of infection shifted to a low level soon in March.</p>

<p>China has imposed stringent regulations to halt the spread of the virus, such as putting the epicenter under lockdown, closing all the schools and restricting travel. These measures are controversial because they cost individual freedom and massive economic loss. Therefore, the paper put forward an indicator, Intervention Efficacy (IE), to evaluate the effectiveness of the containment effort of the government.</p>

<p>Let me assume that the attack rate (AR) in one country is observed, and the subscript i indicates the day after intervention. Relative risk (RR) is calculated by the attack rates (Halloran, Longini, Cowart &amp; Nizam, 2002). The bigger the IE is, the more effective the controlling measures are.</p>

<p align="center"><font  size=5>IE = 1 - AR<sub>i+1</sub>/AR<sub>i</sub> = 1 - RR
</font></p> 

<p><img src="/images/efficacy.png" alt="figure 3" title="Intervention Efficacy" />
<p align="left"><font color=gray size=4>Figure 3. The Effectiveness of Government Intervention in Controlling the Epidemic in China
</font></p></p>

<p>Figure 3 displayed that some positive signs appeared roughly 15 days after the regulations came into effect. A slump on the 20th day was believed to be caused by an increase in diagnosis methods. More patients were included in the outbreak’s tally because they could be identified by lung scans in addition to test kits. A month later, the intervention curbed the outbreak strikingly by diminishing the relative risk of contracting the virus. The indicator helps to gauge government intervention in combating a health threat. However, it also has limitations, such as being insensitive to the magnitude of the number of infection cases that requires further enhancement.</p>
