<p>A growing body of research has explored the ideological differences in reading. Shi and colleagues (2017) found the partisan distinctiveness in the consumption of science books.
Consumers for liberal political books favor basic science, while conservative consumers prefer applied and commercial science. Hoffman examined the political nature of reading and revealed that the reading preference became polarized over time between Federalists and Democratic-Republicans in American elite society in the 18th century. The fundamental premise is that people become aligned with the systems of political ideas through the consumption of books.</p>

<p>This study employs network analysis to investigate the different reading patterns of liberal and conservative readers and how they change over time. More importantly, the study also delves into the impact of economic structure on the ideological preferences of readers. For example, do trade openness and economic growth lead to more liberal readers? What is the intrinsic association between economic liberalization and political alignment?  This research seeks to shed light on the political ideology of Chinese readers and the seed of democratization in the enigmatic authoritarian regime.</p>

<p>An outline of the research is presented in figure 1.</p>

<h3 id="data-description">Data description</h3>

<p>The data was crawled from Douban.com, the most popular online reading community in China. I randomly generated a sample of 1 million users and collected roughly 120,000 users’ book collections from 2005 to 2019. The book collection is comprised of when the users tag the books (read/reading/wish), the information of the books and the address of the users (city-level).</p>

<p>The other part of the data is (economic openness of the cities) regional economic indicators, which were collected from the national bureau of statistics of china website.</p>

<h3 id="preliminary-analysis">Preliminary Analysis</h3>

<p>This study employed the liberal-conservative spectrum to define the political alignment among Chinese netizens. Specifically, liberals advocate democratic institutions, such as multiparty systems and suffrage, and the protection of individual freedom. By contrast, conservatives uphold authoritarian institutions and the priority of state interests over individual rights.</p>

<p>To obtain a general understanding of the reading habits of liberal and conservative readers, I first coded 20 liberal and conservative books (10 for each category). Those solely read liberal or conservative books were included in the subsequent analysis. I then conducted the the likelihood-ratio test, also known as G<sup>2</sup>, to determine the significant difference of book preference between politically divergent readers. The value of G<sup>2</sup> statistic indicates the political inclination of the books (The increase of the value suggests more association with liberal books).</p>

<p>As shown in figure 2a and 2b, I found that conservative readers prefer Chinese philosophy, the biography of political leaders and computer science, whereas liberal readers embrace modern novels and romance.</p>
