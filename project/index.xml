      <description>Political Polarization in China? Political polarization is one of the most heatedly discussed issues in America. A great number of research papers delve into the topic.

The idea was inspired by the paper The Geometry of Culture: Analyzing Meaning through Word Embeddings, which corroborated the effectiveness of the new methodological tool word embedding by constructing different cultural dimensions.
