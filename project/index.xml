      <description>Recently, I crawled data from a website and sucessfully retrieved approximately 290,000 Chinese book summaries. I applied a neural-network word embedding model to discover the culture dimensions hidden under the large-scale book summaries.The idea was inspired by the paper The Geometry of Culture: Analyzing Meaning through Word Embeddings, which corroborated the effectiveness of the new methodological tool word embedding by constructing different cultural dimensions.
First of all, due to the different sentence structure between Chinese and English, it was essential to seperate Chinese and remove stopwords before training the model.</description>
