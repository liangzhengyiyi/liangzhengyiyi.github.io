      <description>“Just as there are odors that dogs can smell and we cannot, as well as sounds that dogs can hear and we cannot&amp;hellip;Perhaps there are thoughts we cannot think.

      <description>Bit by Bit: social research in the digital age is written by Matthew Salganik, a professor at Princeton University, who has great interest in computational social science. Computational social science is a brand-new research filed without specific guidelines or principles. This book is perhaps the first “textbook” in the area. Based on the book, I would like to share some thoughts with regard to dataset and research method in the digital age.</description>
