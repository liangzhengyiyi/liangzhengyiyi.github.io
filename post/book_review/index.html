Computational social science is a brand-new research filed without specific guidelines or principles. This book is perhaps the first “textbook” in the area. Based on the book, I would like to share some thoughts with regard to dataset and research method in the digital age.</p>

<p>First of all, in the digital age researchers are overwhelmed by the datasets which can be derived from the Internet effortlessly. Nevertheless, data quality is a central and controversial issue. Some researchers argue that most of the datasets from the Internet are not representative samples, which is unfeasible for out-of-sample generalization. Therefore, findings based on the data are not solid and compelling. In this regard, Salganik acknowledged that datasets from the Internet are not perfect, but instead of critiquing the drawbacks of the datasets and doing nothing, he encouraged researchers to ask different questions. Are there certain research questions suitable for the datasets? What can we learn from the datasets? By doing that, it is more likely for researchers to make better use of the datasets and achieve intriguing and valuable discovery.</p>

<p>Second, there is no reason to despise or discard traditional research methods. Instead, it is always a better idea to modernize traditional methods. Salganik listed many creative studies in the book which modernized traditional research methods and acomplished great results. For instance, a research team conducted an online large-scale experiment by delivering political messages to 61 million Facebook users during the 2010 US congressional elections. For a very long time, the experiment has been arguably the ideal method to establish causal relationship in social science. In the past, it can only be carried out in a specific place which imposes restrictions on the number and diversity of the participants. Nowadays, an online experiment is open to anyone who has access to the Internet, which indicates that researchers can recruit participants from over 1 billion Internet users all around the world. In this case, researchers are more likely to discover new universal patterns or theory across culture.In conclusion, it is a great opportunity to research with modernized research methods in the digital age.</p>
