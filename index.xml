      <title>Constructing Ideological Space: Estimating Political Attitudes through Chinese People’s Consumption of Books </title>

      <description>Abstract Ideology has been a focus issue in the domain of political science. Researchers have long depended on a survey to measure political attitudes, but the method is expensive and limited to time and space. Hence, a great many studies took an unconventional approach to quantify ideology based on discrete behavioral data, including roll-call votes and social media’s endorsement, and generated reliable outcomes. This study contributed to that promising research avenue by estimating ideology through people’s reading patterns.</description>

      <title>Does economic openness create more liberal readers in China?</title>
      <link>https://liangzhengyiyi.github.io/project/readers/</link>

      <description>A growing body of research has explored the ideological differences in reading. Shi and colleagues (2017) found the partisan distinctiveness in the consumption of science books. Consumers for liberal political books favor basic science, while conservative consumers prefer applied and commercial science. Hoffman examined the political nature of reading and revealed that the reading preference became polarized over time between Federalists and Democratic-Republicans in American elite society in the 18th century.</description>

      <title>Popularity determines how Chinese netizens select a political book rather than political alignment</title>

      <description>Political Polarization in China? Political polarization is one of the most heatedly discussed issues in America. A great number of research papers delve into the topic. Recently, I have been exploring large-scale political books data derived from an online reading community. The data is composed of users’ book collections (When a user takes an interest in a book, she/he tags it). When I was probing into the data, one question struck me: is there political polarization in China?</description>

      <title>The Geometry of Culture: How Chinese perceive and apprehend politics</title>

      <description>Recently, I crawled data from a website and successfully obtained approximately 290,000 Chinese book summaries. I employed a neural-network word embedding model to discover the culture dimensions hidden under the large-scale book summaries. The idea was inspired by the paper The Geometry of Culture: Analyzing Meaning through Word Embeddings, which corroborated the effectiveness of the new methodological tool word embedding by constructing different cultural dimensions.

      <title>How to expedite the process of data crawling?</title>

      <description>Recently, I crawled a set of users&amp;rsquo; book collections from an online community. First I randomly generated about 1 million user ids and obtained book collections by iterating the search. Because some user ids were invalid, over 110,000 users’ book collections were acquired eventually. To crawl a large dataset, web crawlers have to confront a major challenge, which is how to expedite the process since most websites designed Anti-crawlers tactics to obstruct crawling.</description>

      <title> Machine Learning: Thinking Unthinkable</title>

      <description>“Just as there are odors that dogs can smell and we cannot, as well as sounds that dogs can hear and we cannot&amp;hellip;Perhaps there are thoughts we cannot think. Evolution, so far, possibly have blocked us from being able to think in some directions, there could be unthinkable thoughts.’’ A quote from Richard Hamming, a prestigious mathematician. The machine is probably the extension of a human brain, which is critical to unthinkable thoughts.</description>

      <title>Book Review of Bit by Bit: Social Research in the Digital Age</title>
      <link>https://liangzhengyiyi.github.io/post/book_review/</link>

      <description>Bit by Bit: social research in the digital age is written by Matthew Salganik, a professor at Princeton University, who has great interest in computational social science. Computational social science is a brand-new research filed without specific guidelines or principles. This book is perhaps the first “textbook” in the area. Based on the book, I would like to share some thoughts with regard to dataset and research method in the digital age.</description>

      <title>Replication of the Spread of True and False News Online </title>

      <description>According to the data and code shared by the researchers, I replicate the results of the study.
Access to the paper:http://science.sciencemag.org/content/359/6380/1146
Author Soroush Vosoughi, Deb Roy, Sinan Aral
Central Findings They found that false news was more novel than true news, which suggests that people were more likely to share novel information. Whereas false stories inspired fear, disgust, and surprise in replies, true stories inspired anticipation, sadness, joy, and trust.</description>

      <description>I am a graduate student at Nanjing University in China. I am studying in the Computational Communication Lab with research interest in political communication and computational social science. While embracing computational methodology, I am also familiar with traditional research methods, such as survey and experiment.
My recent study investigates how Chinese netizens perceive and understand politics by analyzing a large scale of political books data from an online reading community.</description>
