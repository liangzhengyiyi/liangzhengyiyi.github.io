      <description>As Richard Hamming said, “just as there are odours that dogs can smell and we cannot, as well as sounds that dogs can hear and we cannot&amp;hellip;Perhaps there are thoughts we cannot think. Evolution, so far, may possibly have blocked us from being able to think in some directions, there could be unthinkable thoughts.’’ Machine is probably the extension of human brain, which is the key to unthinkable thoughts.
I participated in a workshop about machine learning in Nanjing University in January, 2019.</description>

      <title>Book Review of Bit by Bit: social research in the digital age</title>

      <description>Bit by Bit: social research in the digital age is written by Matthew Salganik, a professor of Princeton University, who has great interests in computational social science. Computational social science is a brand-new research filed without many guidelines or principles. This book is perhaps the first “textbook” in the field. Based on the book, I would like to share some thoughts with regards to datasets and methods in the digital age.</description>

      <description>According to the data and code shared by the researchers, I replicate the results of the study.

Author Soroush Vosoughi, Deb Roy, Sinan Aral
Central Findings They found that false news was more novel than true news, which suggests that people were more likely to share novel information. Whereas false stories inspired fear, disgust, and surprise in replies, true stories inspired anticipation, sadness, joy, and trust.</description>
